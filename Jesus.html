    <p> <strong>Christianity</strong> has been the most believed religion forever. I myself have <br>
      Only been a beliver for a few months, every since I have accepted Christ<br>
      my life has become incredible, I very rarely feel anger or hate, I feel <br>
      happier and mt life circumstances have improved. I've become a kinder <br>
      person and I feel less fear and stress knowing he's in control.

      Religion is something that I got into with my friends, we started just before<br>
      last summer and worked on our relationships with the lord all summer and worked<br>
      towards being the best people we can be. We worked our hardest to become our full<br>
      potential that our lord Jesus Christ intended for us. Our lives have been better<br>
      than ever and I don't just feel closer with the lord, but with them.
