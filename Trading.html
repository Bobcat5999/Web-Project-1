      Forex trading or foreign exchange trading is an easy fast way to make money at home, <br>
      it can also be turned into a career by working at an investment banking firm. <br>
      The most popular exchange that is made is EURUSD, how it works is you buy euros when the <br>
      Value is low, and sell when the value is high, taking your profit in United States Dollars. <br>
      There is many strategies and techniques that need to be learned that may take a while, <br>
      the most people follow the support and resistance lines and make impulsive trades when <br>
      the market is non directional because they are impatient, The very profitable traders wait for <br>
      an uptrend or a downtrend and wait for fair value gaps to guarentee a market reversal then use a <br>
      4:1 reward to risk ratio to minimize loss and maximize profit.

      Preparing to trade the market is easy but time consuming, it involves many hours of backtesting and a <br>
      lot of paper trading. But what is that? paper trading is a form of trading where you make no money <br>
      and lose none. Trading platforms will give you a balance of 100,000 to trade with. However, this money <br>
      doesn't exist. No one profits and no one loses. It's only use is practice and analysis. Backtesting is <br>
      is practicing your strategies and learning the market by looking back at the previous market structure. <br>
      The market often repeats itself and what worked in the past will often work again. <br>
